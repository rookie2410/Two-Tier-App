 
# Flask App with MySQL Docker Setup

This is a simple Flask app that interacts with a MySQL database. The app allows users to submit messages, which are then stored in the database and displayed on the frontend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project directory to store your MySQL environment variables:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

4. Open the `.env` file and add your MySQL configuration:

   ```
   MYSQL_HOST=mysql
   MYSQL_USER=your_username
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
   MYSQL_DB=your_database
   ```

## To run this two-tier application in docker

- First create a docker image from Dockerfile
```bash
docker build -t flaskapp .
```

- Now, make sure that you have created a network using following command
```bash
docker network create twotier
```

- Attach both the containers in the same network, so that they can communicate with each other

i) MySQL container 
```bash
docker run -d --name mysql -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql -v ./message.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/message.sql --network=twotier -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD="admin" -p 3360:3360 mysql:5.7
```
ii) Backend container
```bash
docker run -d --name flaskapp -v mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql -v ./message.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/message.sql --network=twotier -e MYSQL_HOST=mysql -e MYSQL_USER=root -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=admin -e MYSQL_DB=mydb -p 5000:5000 flaskapp:latest
```

## Notes

- Make sure to replace placeholders (e.g., `your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database`) with your actual MySQL configuration.

- This is a basic setup for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you should follow best practices for security and performance.

- Be cautious when executing SQL queries directly. Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.

- If you encounter issues, check Docker logs and error messages for troubleshooting.
